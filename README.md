# Tutorials for Neuromorphoc Computing Beginners
This tutorial aims to introduce the basic knowledge of neuromoprhic computing.
## Features
> 1. Some review articles about neuromorphic computing.
> 2. Neuromorphic device model, which can be used in SPICE and Python.
> 3. Some typical circuits of neuromorphic computing include the read-and-write circuit for a single neuromorphic device and large-scale neuromorphic device control circuits.
> 4. Some neuromorphic computing application examples include PID control, biological Pavlov behavior simulation, etc.
